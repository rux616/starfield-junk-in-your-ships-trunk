Overview
========

Summary
-------
(Adds additional orientations for ship cargo modules.)

Starfield's ship builder is amazing. While it places a number of reasonable constraints on us as we get the ability to make better and better ships, some of those constraints are just silly, and I want to fix that!

This mod tackles one of those constraints. It will let you mount cargo holds (and in the future, other components) in more positions and in different directions on your ship. Want that item to stick on the back, but it only sticks to the side right now? Come on in.

I've started small, with the Sextant 200CM Cargo Hold (shielded and non-shielded varieties), one of the first cargo components available to players. In vanilla Starfield, this piece only mounts to the sides of ships, now you can mount it on the front, back, top, and bottom as well. In fact, the first cargo module I added was the "aft" version of the Sextant 200CM Ballast Cargo Hold, so Junk In Your (Ship's) Trunk just seemed to fit.

I'll be adding other components in the future, so stay tuned; for now, try this out and let me know what you think!

Cargo Expanders
---------------
I know that some people use mods that increase the capacity of cargo modules by 3x or even 10x, so I've included a couple additional plugins that can adjust the capacity of the cargo modules touched by JIYT to match.

Known Issues
------------
- Modules are clean. The vanilla ship modules have a number of decals like scorch marks, dirt streaks, etc. applied to them. Due to the method by which they are applied, I can't reasonably add them until we get access to the CK.
- Module icons (for the added orientations) in the Ship Builder are missing. This is another thing that is probably going to have to wait until we get access to the CK to get fixed.


Installation
============
NOTE: Requires Plugins.txt Enabler (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/4157)

Upgrading
---------
When upgrading major versions (for example v1.whatever to v2.whatever), you need to do a clean install:
- Open the game and load your latest save
- Remove all JIYT-added modules from your ship
- Save your game, then quit
- Uninstall the previous version of the plugin and all its files
- Open the game and load your last save
- You will see a warning about missing the plugin you just uninstalled, choose to continue
- Save your game again, then quit
- Install the new version of the plugin

When upgrading non-major versions (for example v2.something to v2.something-else), you don't need to do anything except replace the installed mod files.

Mod Manager
-----------
Download and install the archive with either Mod Organizer 2 v2.5.0 Beta 14 or later (MO2 Discord server (https://discord.gg/AKE9wRGpy4), "dev-builds" channel), or Vortex (https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1). I personally recommend Mod Organizer 2 (with the optional Root Builder (https://kezyma.github.io/?p=rootbuilder) plugin to use with SFSE or any other mod that requires files be put directly in the game's installation folder).

To enable plugins.txt support in Mod Organizer 2, set the "enable_plugin_management" option to "True" in the "Tools" menu -> "Settings" option -> "Plugins" tab -> "Game" section -> "Starfield Support Plugin" plugin.

Manual (NOT RECOMMENDED)
------------------------
Extract the archive to your Starfield installation's "Data" folder (typically something like "C:\Games\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield\data"). Add the plugin file names to your plugins.txt file if they aren't already there, making sure the ones you want enabled are preceded with "*".

Archive Invalidation
--------------------
Make sure your `StarfieldCustom.ini` file in the "Documents\My Games\Starfield" folder (or your profile folder if using a mod manager and profiles) contains the following:

    [Archive]
    bInvalidateOlderFiles=1
    sResourceDataDirsFinal=
