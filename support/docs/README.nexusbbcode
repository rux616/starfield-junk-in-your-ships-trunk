[size=4][b][u]Summary:[/u][/b][/size]
(Adds additional orientations for ship modules.)

Starfield's ship builder is amazing. While it places a number of reasonable constraints on us as we get the ability to make better and better ships, some of those constraints are just silly, and I want to fix that!

This mod tackles one of those constraints. It will let you mount cargo holds (and in the future, other components) in more positions and in different directions on your ship. Want that item to stick on the back, but it only sticks to the side right now? Come on in.

I've started small, with the Sextant 200CM Cargo Hold (shielded and non-shielded varieties), one of the first cargo components available to players. In vanilla Starfield, this piece only mounts to the sides of ships, now you can mount it on the front, back, top, and bottom as well. In fact, the first cargo module I added was the "aft" version of the Sextant 200CM Ballast Cargo Hold, so Junk In Your (Ship's) Trunk just seemed to fit.

I'll be adding other components in the future, so stay tuned; for now, try this out and let me know what you think!

[size=4][b][u]Known Issues:[/u][/b][/size]
- Collision isn't exact. We don't have the tools that BGS used to create the meshes, so collision for the rotated modules isn't going to precisely match their vanilla counterparts, which means that selecting these isn't going to be exact. It should be reasonably close though.
- Modules are clean. The vanilla ship modules have a number of decals like scorch marks, dirt streaks, etc. applied to them. Due to the method by which they are applied, I can't reasonably add them until we get access to the CK.
- Module icons (for the added orientations) in the Ship Builder are missing. This is another thing that is probably going to have to wait until we get access to the CK to get fixed.


[size=5][b]Installation[/b][/size]
NOTE: Requires [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/4157]Plugins.txt Enabler[/url]

[size=4][b][u]Mod Manager:[/u][/b][/size]
Download and install the archive with either Mod Organizer 2 v2.5.0 Beta 14 or later ([url=https://discord.gg/AKE9wRGpy4]MO2 Discord server[/url], "dev-builds" channel), or [url=https://www.nexusmods.com/site/mods/1]Vortex[/url]. I personally recommend Mod Organizer 2 (with the optional [url=https://kezyma.github.io/?p=rootbuilder]Root Builder[/url] plugin to use with SFSE or any other mod that requires files be put directly in the game's installation folder).

To enable plugins.txt support in Mod Organizer 2, set the "enable_plugin_management" option to "True" in the "Tools" menu -> "Settings" option -> "Plugins" tab -> "Game" section -> "Starfield Support Plugin" plugin.

[size=4][b][u]Manual (NOT RECOMMENDED):[/u][/b][/size]
Extract the archive to your Starfield installation folder (typically something like "C:\Games\SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Starfield").
