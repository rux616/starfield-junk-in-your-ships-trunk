	<Description>(Cargo holds, fuel tanks, grav drives, shields, weapons. You want variety? We got variety. Adds new flips and decorative versions of many different ship modules.)

NOTE: Now requires Ship Builder Categories (https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield/mods/7310) - you will get a CTD without it installed and above this mod in your load order!

You want variety? We got variety! Up? Yes! Down? Also yes! Left? Still yes! Right? You get three guesses, and the first two don't count! The JIYT Consortium is proud to offer an additional 455 cargo, 444 shield, 309 fuel tank, and 920 grav drive flips/orientations/variants over and above the defaults. Want that module to stick on the back, but it only sticks to the side right now? Come on in.

But wait, there's more! As a bonus, you also get additional decorative versions of all of them! Plus weapons! That's right! All the looks with only a fraction of the cost or weight. And none of the functionality, but who cares about that when your ship looks this good, am I right? You can find these marvelous new modules in the various "Decorative [...]" categories in the Ship Builder.

There are even some additional snap points added so you can do interesting things like putting certain "vertical" modules next to something else, though only for cargo holds and grav drives at the moment; more modules will be converted in the future. (The JIYT Consortium is not responsible for any cursed creations you make with this feature.)</Description>
