	<Description>(Adds additional orientations for ship modules.)

Starfield's ship builder is amazing. While it places a number of reasonable constraints on us as we get the ability to make better and better ships, some of those constraints are just silly, and I want to fix that!

This mod tackles one of those constraints. It will let you mount cargo holds (and in the future, other components) in more positions and in different directions on your ship. Want that item to stick on the back, but it only sticks to the side right now? Come on in.

I've started small, with the Sextant 200CM Cargo Hold (shielded and non-shielded varieties), one of the first cargo components available to players. In vanilla Starfield, this piece only mounts to the sides of ships, now you can mount it on the front, back, top, and bottom as well. In fact, the first cargo module I added was the "aft" version of the Sextant 200CM Ballast Cargo Hold, so Junk In Your (Ship's) Trunk just seemed to fit.

I'll be adding other components in the future, so stay tuned; for now, try this out and let me know what you think!</Description>
